**Queueing at The Counters**
- add a counter queue to each counter
- maximum queue length for each counter queue is l
- allows outside classes to interact with the queue **through the counter**, not the queue directly. don't expose the queue.

arrival:

**customer**
- int (or float) amount

**withdrawal and deposit**
- other classes to interact with the amount through the methods, not directly 

**counter**
- change the tostring method to include the amount. rather than events calling the tostring method from amount
- Counter implements Comparable<Counter>

**T**
- T extends comparT
