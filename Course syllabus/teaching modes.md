<h2>Lectures</h2>  

- The lectures closely follow the course notes. Students are encouraged to read through the notes before the lectures.
- The lectures will be recorded. Screencasts of the lectures will be posted online within 2 days after the lecture. This will be done on a 'best effort' basis. The screencast is not guaranteed to be available on time, or at all. Posting of the screencast is meant to help students who attended the lecture to recap the content or to help those who are not able to attend the lecture due to unexpected circumstances. It is not meant to be a replacement for lecture attendance. Students are encouraged to attend the lectures live so that they can interact and ask questions.
- Lecture slides will be posted after the class. Note that slides are used as a visual aid during the lectures. It is not meant as a summary of lectures nor a replacement for lecture notes.

<h2>Recitations</h2>  
The weekly 1-hour recitation sessions (starting Week 3) allow students to interact with the teaching staff in smaller groups and discuss the problem sets.

- **Attendance will be taken**
- Students who cannot attend a recitation session should inform their corresponding tutor.
- Students are expected to attend their assigned recitation session. If there is a strong need to attend another session for a specific week, the student must inform the corresponding tutors.

<h2>Labs</h2>
The weekly 2-hour lab sessions (starting Week 3) allow students to participate in hands-on learning activities.

- Activity varies, but in most weeks, students and lab tutors will discuss the programming exercises and explore the thought process and different solutions together.
- The lab sessions are usually where most of the learning happens.
- **Attendance will be taken.**
- Students who cannot attend a lab session should inform their corresponding tutor.
- Students are expected to attend their assigned lab session. If there is a strong need to attend another session for a specific week, the student must inform the corresponding tutor.

<h2>Catch-Up Sessions</h2>

**Every three weeks, we run a 2-hour Q&A session for students to clarify doubts on Saturday morning**

- Attendance is optional, but we strongly encourage students who are falling behind to take this opportunity to clarify doubts and catch up.
- Catch-up sessions will be recorded on a "best-effort" basis. The video will be shared after the session.
