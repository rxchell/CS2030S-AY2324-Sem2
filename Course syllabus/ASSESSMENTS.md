Assessments and Their Weightage
There are two types of assessment, formative and summative assessments.

Formative assessments include problem sets, programming assignments, past year questions, and online quizzes. They carry little weight and are meant to help students self-diagnose their learning to improve their software development skills and enhance their understanding of the concepts taught in class. They are also meant to make students think deeper about the lessons, apply what they learn, and gain experience and confidence in their ability to develop complex software. Despite the smaller weightage, we expect that students spend most of their time on formative assessments.

The summative assessments, on the other hand, are meant to evaluate student learning. These include two written assessments (the midterm and the final exam) and three practical exams. These are high-stakes assessments carrying 90% of the total weights.

The types of assessments include:

Problem Sets: After every lecture (starting Week 3), we will provide some problems to make students reflect and practice applying what they have learned. These questions are not graded. There is no need to submit answers for grading. They will be discussed and presented during the recitation sessions.
Past Year Test Papers: Past year test papers are made available for practice. These are not graded. There is no need to submit answers for grading. Selected questions may be discussed during class. They can be discussed on Ed.
Quizzes: The online quizzes are released every week after the lecture (Monday, 2 PM) and are due two days later (Wednesday, 11:59 PM). The quizzes are more tightly coupled to the content of the weekly lectures and are meant to help students self-diagnose their understanding of what is taught for that week. You may attempt the quizzes an unlimited number of times. We will consider only your highest score.
Lab Exercises: These are programming questions of various difficulty levels that are critical for students to solve, to gain experience, skills, and confidence in applying CS2030S concepts to programming. Typically students spend more than half of their time in CS2030S on solving these lab exercises. Students should submit them on time to get feedback from their lab tutors.
Practical Exams: Students will be given programming questions to solve within a limited time frame, in an examination setting in SoC computer labs. This is usually held in the evening or on a Saturday.
Midterm and Final Exams are written tests (on pen and paper) conducted in exam halls.
All summative assessments, i.e., practical exams and written exams, are closed book assessments.
