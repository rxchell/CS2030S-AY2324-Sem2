```Java
class BankAccount {
  double balance;

  BankAccount(double initBalance) {
      this.balance = initBalance;
  }
}

class Customer {
  BankAccount account;

  Customer() {
    this.account = new BankAccount(0);
  }

  public void deposit(double amount) {
    this.account.balance += amount;
  }

  public boolean withdraw(double amount) {
    if (this.account.balance >= amount) {
      this.account.balance ­= amount;
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
}
```

(a) Does this program follow the principle of information hiding? Explain.
</br> BankAccount class has a public balance field, which means the internal state of the BankAccount object is exposed and can be modified directly from outside the class. This violates the principle of information hiding, as it doesn't encapsulate the internal details of the BankAccount class.

(b) Does the program follow the principle of “Tell, Don’t Ask?” Explain.
</br>  The program partially follows the principle of "Tell, Don't Ask." The Customer class does encapsulate the BankAccount object within it, and it doesn't directly expose the BankAccount's balance to the outside world. However, the deposit and withdraw methods in the Customer class are accessing and modifying the balance directly, which is a violation of the principle. It would be better to encapsulate these operations within the BankAccount class.

(c) If you believe that the program violates the principles outlined in Parts (a) and (b), then you should revise the program so that it adheres to these principles.
```Java
class BankAccount {
  private double balance;

  BankAccount(double initBalance) {
      this.balance = initBalance;
  }

  public double getBalance() {
      return balance;
  }

  public void deposit(double amount) {
      this.balance += amount;
  }

  public boolean withdraw(double amount) {
      if (this.balance >= amount) {
          this.balance -= amount;
          return true;
      }
      return false;
  }
}

class Customer {
  private BankAccount account;

  Customer() {
    this.account = new BankAccount(0);
  }

  public void deposit(double amount) {
    this.account.deposit(amount);
  }

  public boolean withdraw(double amount) {
    return this.account.withdraw(amount);
  }

  public double getBalance() {
    return this.account.getBalance();
  }
}
```
In this revised version, the balance field in the BankAccount class is private, and accessor methods (getBalance, deposit, and withdraw) are provided to interact with the balance field. This way, the internal state of BankAccount is hidden, and operations are encapsulated within the class, adhering to the principles of information hiding and "Tell, Don't Ask."
